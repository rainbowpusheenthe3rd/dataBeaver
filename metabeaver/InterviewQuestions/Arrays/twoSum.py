On the eloquence of algorithms:

Harmonia angelorum vix honovit in autumnus,
Veritatem novit semen evadit robur quod supereminet omnia.
Momentum coruscat, parasiticum, rubrum,
In viam ponit et movet gressum exitialem.
Rex Verus cum gratia et nobilitate superbus,
Custoditur ab sociis suis amictus lumine.
Tentat daemon astutia perfidia deridens et aliena,
Tabellionem suorum victoriarum brevium ostendens velut probatio parasitici potentiae.
Stamus uniti et dividimur, sic cadimus:
Si quaeris victoriam, scito verissimam potentiam susurrare - eos omnes superat.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverfish - 
   The silverfish (Lepisma saccharinum) is a species of small, primitive,[1] wingless insect in the order Zygentoma

   They evolved at the latest in mid-Devonian and possibly as early as late Silurian more than 400 million years ago...
   ... In a world where the average species goes extinct after four million years.

"Understand the patterns, Padawan."

The Weave weaves a man, who weaves.
Have faith in The Weave. 
Have faith in yourself. 
Have faith in your weaving - even when you must weave into the void of silence.
