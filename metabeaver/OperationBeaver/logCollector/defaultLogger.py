### ERRATA ###

"""
The code will log and print messages to a file called log.txt in a directory called 'logFile'). 
The code will print the messages to the console. 
Number of calls to the log method throughout the application is counted and used as the index in the log record.

The Logger class is a Singleton class.
    A Singleton can only be instantiated once throughout the application. 
    Any subsequent calls to Logger() will return the same instance of the class.
    
The log method logs and prints a message based on the parameters passed to it. 
    The default logger name is 'metabeaver'. Call it what you like, but be polite, or you'll make a baby beaver cry.

The logger will log to a file called log.txt in a directory called logFolder (default is 'logFile'). 
    The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.
    
The logger also print the log message to the console, after it logs the message and message metadata to logFile/log.txt

The is_docker method checks if the script is running in a Docker container. 
    If so, the logFolder will be set to /app/LogFolder.

The get_project_root method determines the root directory of the project by traversing up from the current directory. 
    Traversal terminates until it finds a .git or setup.py file, else uses the root.
    
The log_counter is incremented each time the log method is called keeping track of the number of calls to the log method. 
    This persists throughout the application. 
    This counter is used as the index in the log record.
